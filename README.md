## Site User
The primary users of book_shelf are anyone who would like to share or recommend books based on their reading experiences and preferences. It aims to provide a supportive and inclusive community where the site users can share their feelings about books and recommend books to other like-minded readers. They value authenticity, empathy, and the opportunity to engage with like-minded individuals in a safe and welcoming space.

## Purposes for the site
To provide inspirations for someone who is seeking new books to read and build meaningful connections with other readers. The site commits for an environment where users feel encouraged to share or recommend their books.

# agile

## Agile development

For the development of book_shelf, Agile methodology used to ensure iterative and efficient progress throughout the project lifecycle. Central to this approach was the utilization of a Kanban board hosted on GitHub Projects. You can view the project board as: [KANBAN Board](https://github.com/users/Grace-YuGuo/projects/6).

 -![Kanban Mockup](documentation/screenshots/Kanban_board.webp)

### Kanban overview
The Kanban board served as a visual representation of the project's progress and allowed for effective task management. It consisted of the following sections:

- Todo: This section contained all the tasks and user stories that were yet to be prioritized for implementation.
- In Progress: Work in progress was tracked here, indicating tasks actively being worked on.
- Done: Tasks that were completed successfully were moved to this column.

### User Stories Integration
User stories played a pivotal role in shaping the development process, ensuring that features were aligned with user needs. These user stories were mapped onto the Kanban board, guiding the prioritization and implementation of tasks.

### Task Management
In addition to tracking user stories, the Kanban board served as a comprehensive task list. I utilized it to break down user stories into smaller, actionable tasks, ensuring clear and manageable objectives for development. This granular approach facilitated efficient progress tracking and enhanced team collaboration.

By leveraging Agile principles and utilizing the Kanban board effectively, the development of book_shelf remained focused, adaptable, and responsive to evolving requirements, resulting in a more robust and user-centric Django blog application.
