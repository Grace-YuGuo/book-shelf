# agile

## Agile development

In the app of book_shelf development life-cycle, Agile methodology was used to ensure iterative and efficient progress throughout the project development. Central to this approach was the utilization of a Kanban board hosted on GitHub Projects. You can view the project board as: [KANBAN Board](https://github.com/users/Grace-YuGuo/projects/6).

 -![Kanban Mockup](documentation/screenshots/Kanban_board.webp)

### Kanban overview
The Kanban board served as a visual representation of the project's progress and allowed for effective task management,enhanced visibility,increased efficiency,to assess and improve the flow of work. It consisted of the following sections:

- Todo: This section contained all the tasks and user stories that were yet to be prioritized for implementation.
- In Progress: Work in progress was tracked here, indicating tasks actively being worked on.
- Done: Tasks that were completed successfully were moved to this column.

### User Stories Integration
User stories played a pivotal role in shaping the development process, ensuring that features were aligned with user needs.User storires integration into Kanban board is an effective way to manage and prioritize tasks while ensuring that project progress remains aligned with the goals and needs of users.  These user stories were mapped onto the Kanban board, guiding the prioritization and implementation of tasks, enhanced focusing on usr needs, better visibility and tracking, and increased flexibility.

### Task Management
In addition to tracking user stories, the Kanban board served as a comprehensive task list. User stories were breaking into smaller, actionable units of tasks, ensuring clear and manageable objectives for development. This specific approach facilitated efficient progress tracking.By leveraging Agile principles and utilizing the Kanban board effectively, the development of book_shelf remained focused, adaptable, and responsive to evolving requirements, resulting in a more robust and user-centric Django application.
